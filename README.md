**Description**

This program is a 2-player competitve dice game where you must balance risk and reward. You can roll the dice as many times as you want during your turn, but when you roll a 1, it automatically goes to the other player's turn. If you are comfortable with the score you have gotten in that turn, you can hold to add that turn score to your total score. The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the game.

**Necessary Installations**

None. Just open up the HTML webpage.

**Usage**

Once players 1 and 2 have been assigned, start the game by clicking the "ROLL DICE" button. Player 1 will always go first. Keep rolling until you are comfortable enough to hold what your current score is. Add your current score to your total score by clicking the "HOLD" button for the player's respective side. If a 1 is rolled, the game will automatically hand control to the other player. Once a player has reached a score of 100, the game will be over and that player will win. To play again without reloading the page, click the "NEW GAME" button.
